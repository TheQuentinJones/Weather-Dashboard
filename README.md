# Weather Dashboard

## Description

    This webpage is a 5-day forecast. There were some issues with rendering this project how I wanted it to look.
    This will be a work in progress and will be updated constantly as more issues are resolved.

    The functionality of this webpage is supposed to show a 5-day forecast for a city of the users choice. The user
    will input a city and the city's forecast will appear on the screen. The screen will also leave a button so that
    the user can easily go back and look at their previous searches.

## Installation

    There is no installation necessary. When this project is up and working, it will work in any browser and can be accessed
    using this link:

    Happy Forecasting!
